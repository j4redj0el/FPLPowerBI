# Using PowerBI to make Fantasy Premier League (FPL Decisions) 

## Introduction 
Fantasy Premier League is an online game in which players collect points based on how real-life footballers perform each week. Simply put: you choose a virtual team of Premier League footballers, and if their real-life counterparts do well, you get points. 

If you have Erling Haaland in your FPL team and he scores a goal for Manchester City, you will earn points. Simple, right? Similarly, if you have Jordan Pickford as your goalkeeper and he keeps a clean sheet, you will be rewarded. (explanation from fourfourtwo.com) 

## Aim of Project 
This project uses Power BI to help FPL managers (players) select the best players for their teams. The Power BI file in this repository contains three dashboards designed to support decision-making and optimize player selection.
